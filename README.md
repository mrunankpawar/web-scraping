# Learn about Web Scraping

## What is Web scraping?
-> Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites.

## Why Web scraping?
-> Web scraping can help you extract any kind of data that you want. You would then be able to retrieve, analyze and use the data the way you want. So web scraping simplifies the process of extracting data, speeds it up by automating it and creates easy access to the scrapped data by providing it in a CSV format.
